1) Using your VM login using the root account 
2) Create a directory called /Labs/chap4/your-last-name under /root directory, then cd to /root/Labs/chap4. 
3) Create a directory and file structure as follows using mkdir to create the directories and touch to create the files. Note the directory names, file names, and permissions. Your structure should look identical. I’ve also included a long listing of the structure below the screenshot. View your structure from Labs/chap4 using:
2/
Ug+ (this is to make sure you’re in the /root/Labs/chap4 directory
tree -p your-last-name cd cc 



tree -p Pojanakanokporn/ /Lab2/chap4/pojpojanakanokpo../../cd
ls -lR your-last-name 

4) When you have finished run the following two commands from your /root/Labs/chap4 directory to create 2 txt files:

tree -p your-last-name > your-last-name-tree.txt
ls -l -R your-last-name > your-last-name-list.txt
5)  I will show you how to upload the 2 txt files to your host.
